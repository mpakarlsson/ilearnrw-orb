index.message = This site was developed as part of the iLearnRW project. It is a resource for teachers, parents and students who want help with phonics. Unlike standard text readability tools online, this site not only displays a total score for any text but also gives a heatmap of difficulties and can link any individual word to potential problems. It can also help by giving examples of words with similar features. You can check any word. Furthermore, you can learn more about phonics by seeing the big picture.
